Finishing the season with a league-high 49 points and 23 goals, Rambo was an unstoppable playmaker.

Rambo is a Glenside, Pennsylvania native where he attended LaSalle College High School. While playing at the University of Maryland, Rambo was a 3x First Team All-Big Ten selection, a 2x USILA All-American, the 2016 Big Ten Tournament Most Valuable Player, the 2017 Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, the 2017 Enners Award recipient for the Nationâ€™s Most Outstanding Player and the 2017 Tewaaraton Award Winner. Rambo was named to the 2019 PLL All-Star Game and took home the Eamon McEneaney Attackman of the Year.
