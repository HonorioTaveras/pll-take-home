Finishing the season with a league-high 49 points and 23 goals, Rambo was an unstoppable playmaker. Rambo's skillset was put on display in the biggest moment of the season when his game winning goal in overtime brought Whipsnakes LC the title. Rambo is a Glenside, Pennsylvania native where he attended LaSalle College High School. While playing at the University of Maryland, Rambo was a 3x First Team All-Big Ten selection, a 2x USILA All-American, the 2016 Big Ten Tournament Most Valuable Player, the 2017 Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, the 2017 Enners Award recipient for the Nationâ€™s Most Outstanding Player and the 2017 Tewaaraton Award Winner. Rambo was named to the 2019 PLL All-Star Game and took home the Eamon McEneaney Attackman of the Year. Rambo's favorite food is a hometown Philly cheesesteak and he is a big fan of the film, Law Abiding Citizen.",
